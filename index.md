Hi there,

I am
- currently working on **Java** and have good understanding of **REST, Kafka, Spring, Microservice, APIs**
- learning **AWS, Scala and Akka** in depth.
- open for opportunities.

### Project Experience
  - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software Developer at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fidelity-investments/), with 
    - hands-on experience with Kafka message processing with Kafka Consumers and Kafka Producers.
    - experience in Scala and Akka programming. Good experience with use of Finite State Machines with Scala.
    - exposure to migrating onprem instances of microservices to AWS cloud.
    - hands-on Automation of test cases in Postman, Fitnesse.
    - experience on Junit tests with Mockito.
  
  - ðŸŒ± I started my career at [Mindtree Ltd](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindtreeltd/), as a Fresher.[Past Experience]
    - Worked on an airline domain Project.
      - I have worked on Departure Control System for an Airline Project - [SITA](https://www.sita.aero)
      - My contribution here was to build business logic for Passenger Acceptance during checkin. Baggage Acceptance and Printing of Boarding pass.
      - We used Java for Middle tier development, Oracle DB for Persistence of Data, Swings for Desktop application used for user interaction.
      - We followed Test Driven Development approach with Mockito, Junit.
      - We used microservice architecture. The domain was split into multiple services, some of them handling Passenger Checkin service which allocates Seats after getting the response from Seats service and so on. (We can discuss more, if you are interested!)
    - A Hotel Management system.
      - Worked for a project with Customer data handling with [Marriott International](https://www.marriott.com/)
